# Terminal Kill and Prompt Lifecycle Fixes Summary

## Overview
We've successfully addressed all the bug scenarios identified in PROMPTS.md related to prompt cleanup when processes are killed from the terminal.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Terminal Kill Debounce Fix (`process.ts`)
- **Problem**: 1-second debounce was preventing immediate cleanup of prompts when processes were killed from terminal
- **Solution**: 
  - Terminal kills now use a shorter 100ms debounce instead of 1000ms
  - Terminal kills bypass the debounce check entirely if one is already active
  - This ensures prompts close immediately when Ctrl+C is pressed in the terminal

### 2. Prompt Close Early Return Fix (`prompt.ts`)
- **Problem**: Unfocused prompts would skip cleanup due to early return in close() method
- **Solution**:
  - Added `isProcessExit` check that includes all process exit reasons
  - Process exit scenarios now bypass the focus check entirely
  - This ensures prompts close even if they were never focused

### 3. Process Monitoring Delay Fix (`prompt.ts`)
- **Problem**: 3-second delay before starting process monitoring could miss early process deaths
- **Solution**:
  - Removed the 3-second setTimeout delay
  - Process monitoring now starts immediately with an initial check
  - Regular interval checks continue as before

### 4. Hide Instant Cooldown Fix (`prompt.ts`)
- **Problem**: hideInstant cooldown could prevent hiding during process exit
- **Solution**:
  - Added `forceHide` parameter to hideInstant method
  - Process exit scenarios pass `true` to bypass cooldown
  - Ensures prompt can hide immediately when process exits

## Test Coverage
Created comprehensive tests covering:
- Terminal kill scenarios
- Process exit handling
- Debounce behavior
- Focus state handling
- Cooldown bypassing

## Result
All identified bugs from PROMPTS.md have been fixed. Prompts now properly close when:
- Process is killed from terminal (Ctrl+C)
- Process exits normally
- Process crashes or becomes unresponsive
- Regardless of prompt focus state
- Without delays or cooldown interference
