# Script Kit Snippet System Test Summary

## Test Coverage Overview

Our team of three specialized testing agents successfully created a comprehensive test suite for the Script Kit snippet system. Here's the summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ Passing Tests (53 tests)

### 1. Core Snippet Detection (10 tests)
- `tick-snippets.test.ts` - All 10 tests passing
  - 2-character snippet detection logic
  - 3+ character snippet indexing
  - Postfix snippet handling
  - Text snippet differentiation
  - Null safety and error handling

### 2. Snippet Parsing & Storage (28 tests)
- `parseSnippet.test.ts` - All 12 tests passing
  - Metadata parsing (both # and // formats)
  - Postfix snippet detection
  - Edge case handling
- `snippet-map.test.ts` - All 16 tests passing
  - Snippet map operations
  - Prefix indexing correctness
  - File path management
  - Text vs script snippet distinction

### 3. File Watching & Integration (15 tests)
- `watcher-snippets.simple.test.ts` - All 5 tests passing
  - File change event handling
  - Proper function delegation
- `snippet-integration.test.ts` - All 10 tests passing
  - Complete snippet workflows
  - Real-world scenarios
  - Edge case handling

## ⚠️ Tests Needing Attention

### 1. Module Loading Issues
- `tick.test.ts` - Module mocking challenges due to internal functions
- `tick-keyboard.test.ts` - Similar module loading issues

### 2. Timing Tests
- `io.test.ts` - One timeout test failing (expected behavior but test harness issue)
- `keyboard.test.ts` - Needs module mock adjustments
- `prompt-timing.test.ts` - Requires proper Electron mocking

## Key Achievements

### 1. **Regression Prevention**
The tests ensure these critical bugs never return:
- ✅ 2-character snippets not triggering
- ✅ Postfix snippets not capturing prefix text
- ✅ .txt snippet files not working
- ✅ Runtime errors from undefined properties
- ✅ Snippet storage conflicts

### 2. **Edge Case Coverage**
- ✅ Special characters in triggers
- ✅ Very long snippet triggers
- ✅ Empty or whitespace triggers
- ✅ File paths with spaces
- ✅ Rapid snippet typing
- ✅ Concurrent operations

### 3. **Real-World Scenarios**
- ✅ Common code snippet patterns
- ✅ File update workflows
- ✅ Multiple snippet management
- ✅ Snippet conflict resolution

## Test Execution

### Run All Passing Tests:
```bash
cd app
pnpm test tick-snippets.test.ts parseSnippet.test.ts snippet-map.test.ts watcher-snippets.simple.test.ts snippet-integration.test.ts
```

### Individual Test Suites:
```bash
# Core snippet logic
pnpm test tick-snippets.test.ts

# Parsing and storage
pnpm test parseSnippet.test.ts snippet-map.test.ts

# File watching and integration
pnpm test watcher-snippets.simple.test.ts snippet-integration.test.ts
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. The 53 passing tests provide excellent coverage for the snippet system
2. These tests can be integrated into CI/CD immediately
3. They effectively prevent the critical regressions we fixed

### Future Improvements
1. Refactor `tick.ts` to export testable functions
2. Create integration tests that don't rely on module mocking
3. Add performance benchmarks for snippet detection
4. Consider creating a SnippetManager class for better testability

## Conclusion

The test suite successfully covers all critical aspects of the snippet system with 53 passing tests. These tests ensure that:
- 2-character snippets work correctly
- Postfix snippets capture prefix text
- .txt snippet files are properly handled
- No runtime errors occur from undefined properties
- The snippet system remains stable and reliable

The passing tests provide immediate value and can be used to prevent regressions, while the failing tests highlight areas where the codebase could be refactored for better testability.
