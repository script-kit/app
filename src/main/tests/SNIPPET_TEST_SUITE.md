# Script Kit Snippet System Test Suite

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite created to prevent regressions in the Script Kit snippet system.

## Overview

The test suite was created by a team of three specialized testing agents, each focusing on a critical area of the snippet system:

1. **Agent 1: Snippet Detection & Triggering** - Tests for `tick.ts` and snippet recognition
2. **Agent 2: Prompt Timing & Backspace Tracking** - Tests for `io.ts`, `keyboard.ts`, and prompt synchronization
3. **Agent 3: File Watching & .txt Snippets** - Tests for `watcher.ts` and text snippet handling

## Test Files Created

### Core Snippet Detection Tests

#### `tick-snippets.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Unit tests for snippet detection logic
- **Key Coverage**:
  - 2-character snippet detection (e.g., `,,`)
  - 3+ character snippet detection with last-3-char indexing
  - Postfix snippets (starting with `*`)
  - Prefix text capture for postfix snippets
  - Null safety and error handling
  - Snippet state management (clearing on escape, arrows, clicks)

#### `tick.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Integration tests for the snippet system
- **Key Coverage**:
  - Snippet map management
  - Text snippet loading from files
  - Snippet removal and updates
  - Triggering mechanism

#### `tick-keyboard.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Keyboard event handling for snippets
- **Key Coverage**:
  - Mouse click snippet clearing
  - Escape key behavior
  - Arrow key handling
  - Modifier key behavior
  - Character accumulation
  - Space and backspace handling

### Prompt Timing & Synchronization Tests

#### `io.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Backspace tracking system tests
- **Key Coverage**:
  - `expectBackspaces` promise creation and resolution
  - 5-second timeout protection
  - Memory leak prevention
  - Integration with keydown events
  - Concurrent backspace expectations

#### `keyboard.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Text deletion synchronization tests
- **Key Coverage**:
  - `deleteText` function with backspace tracking
  - Character-by-character deletion
  - Synchronization between deleteText and io.ts
  - Error handling and timeouts
  - `isTyping` state management

#### `prompt-timing.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Prompt display timing tests
- **Key Coverage**:
  - 50ms snippet prompt delay
  - Default prompt display behavior
  - Snippet vs keyboard shortcut prompt behavior
  - Prompt centering for different trigger types
  - Prevention of premature prompt display

### File Watching & Text Snippet Tests

#### `parseSnippet.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Snippet metadata parsing tests
- **Key Coverage**:
  - Parsing both `#` and `//` comment formats
  - Handling extra spaces and malformed metadata
  - Postfix snippet detection
  - Support for both `snippet` and `expand` keys

#### `snippet-map.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: Snippet storage and indexing tests
- **Key Coverage**:
  - Snippet map data structure
  - Prefix indexing for fast lookup
  - 2-char vs 3+ char snippet indexing
  - File path updates and removal
  - Text vs script snippet distinction

#### `watcher-snippets.simple.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: File watcher integration tests
- **Key Coverage**:
  - `handleSnippetFileChange` for add/change/unlink events
  - Proper delegation to addTextSnippet
  - File lifecycle management
  - Multiple file handling

#### `snippet-integration.test.ts`
- **Purpose**: End-to-end integration tests
- **Key Coverage**:
  - Complete snippet workflows
  - Postfix snippet handling
  - Snippet conflicts and updates
  - Real-world scenarios

## Critical Regressions Prevented

These tests ensure the following issues never happen again:

1. **2-character snippets not triggering** - Fixed prefix indexing for short snippets
2. **Postfix snippets not capturing prefix text** - Proper text extraction before trigger
3. **Runtime errors from undefined properties** - Comprehensive null checks
4. **Prompts appearing before deletion completes** - Event-driven synchronization
5. **.txt snippet files not working** - Proper file watching and parsing
6. **Keyboard shortcuts losing centered positioning** - Trigger type differentiation
7. **Memory leaks from unresolved promises** - Proper cleanup and timeouts
8. **Snippet state corruption** - Clear state management rules

## Running the Tests

### Run all snippet tests:
```bash
cd app
pnpm test tick io keyboard prompt-timing watcher-snippets parseSnippet snippet
```

### Run specific test categories:
```bash
# Snippet detection tests
pnpm test tick-snippets.test.ts

# Prompt timing tests
pnpm test prompt-timing.test.ts

# File watching tests
pnpm test watcher-snippets.simple.test.ts
```

### Run with coverage:
```bash
pnpm coverage
```

## Test Maintenance

When modifying snippet functionality:

1. **Always run the full test suite** before committing changes
2. **Update tests** when adding new features or changing behavior
3. **Add new test cases** for any bugs discovered in production
4. **Keep tests focused** - each test should verify one specific behavior
5. **Use descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested and why

## Future Improvements

Consider these enhancements to improve testability:

1. Export internal functions from `tick.ts` for easier unit testing
2. Create a SnippetManager class for better encapsulation
3. Add performance benchmarks for snippet detection
4. Create visual regression tests for prompt positioning
5. Add stress tests for rapid snippet typing

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test suite provides confidence that the snippet system will continue to work reliably. The tests cover all critical paths, edge cases, and the specific bugs that were fixed. With proper maintenance, these tests will prevent regressions and ensure a stable snippet experience for all Script Kit users.
