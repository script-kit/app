    // This test demonstrates the issue with wasRecentlyProcessed
    
    // The logic in watcher.ts is:
    // 1. When a file changes, handleFileChangeEvent is called
    // 2. If it's a script file, it calls onScriptChanged
    // 3. onScriptChanged checks wasRecentlyProcessed(filePath) && !rebuilt
    // 4. If recently processed, it ignores the change
    // 5. Otherwise, it calls madgeAllScripts() which marks ALL scripts as processed
    // 6. This means any legitimate file change within 5 seconds will be ignored
    
    // The bug:
    // - User edits a file
    // - File change is detected, onScriptChanged is called
    // - madgeAllScripts marks the file (and all other scripts) as "recently processed"
    // - If the user saves the file again within 5 seconds, it's ignored
    // - This is problematic because the user's second save is a legitimate change
    
    // The issue is that wasRecentlyProcessed is being used to prevent 
    // cascading changes from madgeAllScripts, but it's also preventing
    // legitimate user changes.
    
    // Potential fix:
    // 1. Only mark files as "recently processed" when they're processed BY madgeAllScripts
    // 2. Don't mark the originally changed file as processed
    // 3. Or use a different mechanism to track madge-initiated vs user-initiated changes
